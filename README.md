# The Supplemental Spinner
## Purpose
“Use this device to break the ice” is The Supplemental Spinner’s slogan. This device was inspired by the college program Supplemental Instruction (SI) and its practices for involving students in group collaborative learning sessions. This device has been donated to Mt. San Jacinto College (MSJC) as a learning device for SI Leaders. SI Leaders are college students who organize sessions for historically difficult courses and aim to benefit college students and their academic performance. This device can be used in those sessions for the purpose to add enjoyment and for “breaking the ice”. When students engage in activities that involves them to speak out and share answers to questions like “what are you most ambitious for” or “what is your major and why did you choose it”, then students find themselves going beyond their comfort zone to share out and this is essential in learning. SI says, “Learning begins from beyond your comfort zone”—and therefore I made “The Supplemental Spinner”. This device can be used for more activities than just breaking the ice, but that is up for the SI Leader to be creative in their own sandbox.

## Featured
This device will be featured at the 3rd Annual Inland Empire SI Regional Conference 2018 in Riverside community college (RCC). Pictures will be posted below:

## The Prototype 
This device began with the creation of the "Syllabus Spinner" (image below). People would ask to borrow this prototype for their  group studying sessions but I was unable to provide. This version is extremely fragile and can fail if handled incorrectly, so I did not want to run the risk of having people borrow a device that could not perform. It still operates to this day and was a great foundation to create “The Supplemental Spinner”.
